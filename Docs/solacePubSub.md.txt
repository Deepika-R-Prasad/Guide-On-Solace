What is Solace PubSub+ Platform?
A complete event streaming and management platform for the real-time enterprise. The
PubSub+ Platform helps enterprises design, deploy, and manage event-driven
architectures (EDAs) across hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, and IoT environments, so they can
be more integrated and event-driven.
PubSub+ Cloud Console
The PubSub+ Cloud Console is the "single pane of glass" that gives you access to the
PubSub+ Platformâ€”a complete event streaming and management platform.
From one console, you can:
Deploy and link brokers to form a global, dynamically-routed event mesh
Monitor event mesh performance
Define, manage, and govern events
Event Streaming
PubSub+ Mission Control gives you access to event broker services that give you all the
messaging features you need, while Solace takes care of deploying and operating your
service. We engineer it all to be secure, resilient, and cost-optimized so you can focus on
building applications and your EDA. In addition to this, you can manage your event broker
services whether they are located in the cloud or on-premises, easily visualize and design
event meshes , securely centralize the management of your EDA, and easily scale to
drive your EDA forward.
Event Insights
With PubSub+ Insights , we do the work to provide curated dashboards, easy-tounderstand
visualizations based on historical and real-time metrics, and timely
notifications about your event broker services. Advanced monitoring helps you to better
manage your services as your EDA scales, and an integrated email framework alerts you
when key metrics fall outside of your established thresholds.
