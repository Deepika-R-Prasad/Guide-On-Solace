Builds on Travis CI are configured mostly through the build configuration stored in the file .travis.yml in your repository. This allows your configuration to be version controlled and flexible.

For advanced use cases the main build configuration file .travis.yml can import other, shared config sources using the Build Config Imports feature.

Detailed information about Travis CIâ€™s build config format can be found in our Travis CI Build Config Reference. 

Some common reasons why builds might hang:

Waiting for keyboard input or other kind of human interaction
Concurrency issues (deadlocks, livelocks and so on)
Installation of native extensions that take very long time to compile
